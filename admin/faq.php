                <p>Fats are predominantly triesters                       of fatty acids and glycerol - commonly known as triglycerides.                       Triglycerides that appear as solid at room temperature are                       normally called fats while those that are liquid are referred                       to as oils. Fat is a vital nutrient that provides the body                       with energy as well as acts as a source of essential fatty                       acids. Current dietary recommendations are that fats should                       supply no more than 30% of a person's energy requirement.                       In terms of energy value a gram of fat yields 9 cal of energy                       compared to 6 cal/g for starch and proteins. </p>

                <p>Saturated fatty acids are                       those which have only single carbon-to-carbon bonds ( C-C                       ). These fatty acids are very stable. Examples of saturated                       fatty acids are palmitic acid, C16:0 and stearic acid, C18:0.                       Unsaturated fatty acids contain carbon-to-carbon double bonds                       ( C=C ). When only one double bond is present in the carbon                       chain, the fatty acid is called monounsaturated ( e.g. oleic                       acid, C18:1 ). When there are more than one double-bond, then                       the fatty acid is called polyunsaturated ( e.g. linoleic acid,                       C18:2 and linolenic acid, C18:3 )</p>

The chemical                       reactivity of polyunsaturated fatty acid also depends on the                       positions of the double bonds. Reactivity increases substantially                       if the double bonds are conjugated <br />

                <p>The melting points of fatty                       acids generally increase with:-</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>increasing chain length </p>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus a short chain saturated                       fatty acid such as butyric acid will have a lower melting                       point than long chain saturated fatty acids <br />
              ( e.g. palmitic acid ) and even some higher chain length unsaturated                       fatty acids ( e.g. oleic acid ). This property is reflected                       when the fatty acids form part of a triglyceride. The more                       saturated oil or fat may not necessarily have a higher melting                       point. For example, coconut oil which is about 87% saturated,                       but contains a high proportion of short chain fatty acids,                       has a melting range of 24&deg;C - 26&deg;C while palm oil                       which is about 49% saturated has a melting point in the range                       of 31&deg;C - 38&deg;C.</p>

                <p>The term cis and trans describe                       the configuration of the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon                       atoms in double bonds of unsaturated oils. In the cis-configuration,                       these hydrogen atoms are located on the same side of the plane                       containing the carbon to carbon double bonds. Most naturally                       occurring fatty acids are cis isomers, but small quantities                       of trans fatty acids do occur naturally in ruminant fats and                       dairy products. However, partial hydrogenation will cause                       the formation of trans-fatty acids.</p>

The process essentially involves the removal of these volatile                       components by steam at about 240-260&deg;C under a vacuum                       of 2-5 mbars.</p>

                <p>The term bleaching refers                       to the process in which the colour of the oil is reduced by                       removal of the colour producing substances - i.e. pigments.                       Bleaching is part of the refining process and involves in                       part the adsorption of colour producing materials on an adsorbent                       material called bleaching earth. Usually, bleaching earth                       does not remove all the colour producing materials, much of                       which are actually removed by thermal destruction during the                       deodorization process.</p>

                <p>Hydrogenation is the process                       most commonly used to convert liquid oils into products which                       have different consistencies, melting points, and textures.                       It is a catalytic process in which the number of double bonds                       are reduced and at the same time, isomerization of residual                       fatty acids promoted. Liquid oils with unsaturated triglycerides                       are transformed into fats containing a higher percentage of                       saturated triglycerides.The complex system consists of three                       phases; liquid oil, gaseous hydrogen and solid catalyst (                       the most widely used is nickel ). As hydrogenation progresses,                       there is a gradual increase in the melting point of the oil                       or fat. Upon full hydrogenation, whereby the double bonds                       are eliminated entirely, the product is a hard brittle solid                       at room temperature.</p>
            <p>The overall hydrogenation                       rate depends on the quality of the reactant involved; the                       degree of refining of the oil to be hydrogenated; the activity,                       concentration and nature of the catalyst; hydrogen pressure;                       reaction temperature; and stirring.</p>

                <p>Fractionation is the process                       used to separate the lower melting point triglycerides from                       the higher melting point triglycerides. The process is based                       on the difference of melting points of the various triglycerides                       and involves crystallization which helps separate the solids                       from liquids. There are essentially three types of fractionation,                       i.e. dry fractionation, detergent fractionation and solvent                       fractionation. All three involve the gradual lowering of temperature                       to induce crystallization and hence separation of higher melting                       point triglycerides ( solid component - called stearin ) from                       the lower melting point triglycerides ( liquid component -                       called olein ).</p>

                <p>Dry fractionation is the process                       in which separation of the solid from liquid portion of the                       oil is achieved by a process of gradual cooling a preheated                       oil. The preheating ( to about 70&deg;C ) is done to destroy                       any crystal present. Crystal formation and growth occurs as                       the oil is agitated and cooled using chilled water circulating                       in the jackets or cooling coils of the crystallizers. When                       the oil reaches the desired temperature, the cooling is stopped.                       The oil which is in the form of slurry is then filtered to                       separate the solid stearin from liquid olein.</p>

                <p>The process involves crystallization                       of the oil and separation of fractions aided by a detergent                       ( sodium lauryl sulphate solution ) and an electrolyte ( magnesium                       sulphate ). The electrolyte helps in agglomeration of oil                       droplets formed during the mixing process. The detergent helps                       in fractionation as it wets the stearin crystals and displaces                       occluded and entrained olein. The lower density olein can                       be separated from the stearin-detergent mixture of higher                       density by centrifuging. The traces of detergent in olein                       can be removed by washing. The heavier stearin phase containing                       most of the detergent is heated to melt the stearin and then                       sent to a second centrifuge where the stearin is separated                       from the detergent. The detergent separated from the stearin                       is then recycled.</p>

                <p>Interesterification is essentially                       is a process which involves the rearrangement or redistribution                       of fatty acids attached to the glycerol part of the triglyceride                       molecule. The rearrangement can be either in random or direct                       manner - depending on the processing conditions. The reaction                       involved generally falls into one of the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Acidolysis - reaction                           of fatty ester with an acid - usually a fatty acid</p>
                  </li>
              <li>
                    <p>Alcoholysis - reaction                           between fat and alcohol</p>

                <p>Yes, there are great differences                       in their physical and chemical properties. Oils and fats are                       made up mostly of triglycerides with some non-glyceridic materials                       in small or trace quantities. Difference in chemical composition                       reflect themselves in differences in physical properties as                       well. The differences between the two oil are as follows :</p>

                <p align="justify">Fractionation                       of palm oil yields olein (liquid) and stearin (solid) fractions.                       Further fractionation of the olein component yields double-fractionated                       olein and palm mid-fraction (PMF). The olein thus obtained                       is usually called superolein as it has a high Iodine Value                       (IV) and therefore has a lower cloud point. </p>

                <p>Heart disease remains the                       biggest cause of death (especially in the Western countries)                       and it increases with age. Even in the developing countries,                       heart disease is on the increase and rising towards the level                       found in the developed countries.</p>
            <p align="justify"> A team of                       medical scientist at Cambridge University studied the effect                       of vitamin E supplements on the health of 2000 patients who                       had suffered a previous heart attack. They found that regular                       high doses of vitamin E of over 400 IU per day reduced the                       risk of a second heart attack by 75%.</p>
            <p align="justify">At present,                       the main source of vitamin E is the deodorizer distillate                       from soyabean oil refining but the oil palm is by far the                       largest potential source.

Are there any new developments in the bleaching                       of oils?</strong> </p>
                <p>The use of activated bleaching                       earth (clay) in the processing of oils and fats has a long                       and successful history.</p>
            <p align="justify">Bleaching                       earths have gradually and steadily improved in quality so                       that with reasonably good crude palm oil, addition of about                       1% enables the desired final colour limit of 3 RED (5.25 inch                       Lovibond cell) to be reached every time.</p>
            <p align="justify">But the performance                       of a bleaching earth cannot be assessed on colour considerations                       alone because the removal of phosphatides and trace metals                       is also very important in ensuring maximum stability to oxidation                       and resistance to flavour deterioration. </p>
            <p align="justify">Now new materials                       are challenging the position of bleaching earth e.g. the development                       of silica hydrogel which, when used to replace part of the                       bleaching earth, lead to equally good colour values in the                       finished oil, and also much better removal of phosphatides.</p>
            <p align="justify">Thus, 0.3%                       hydrogel plus 0.6% bleaching earth gives better removal of                       trace metals and gums than 1.3% bleaching earth alone.&nbsp;</p>

                <p align="justify">Vanaspati                       is a homogenous blend of edible vegetable oils such as cottonseed                       oil, soybean oil, palm oil, rice-bran oil, maize oil and mahua                       oil, which are refined to remove impurities and colour, deodorized                       to remove odour in oils and hydrogenated to form a nutritious                       and pure cooking fat.</p>
            <p align="justify">Only vegetable                       oils are permitted in vanaspati.</p>
            <p align="justify">Vanaspati                       is a cooking fat originally developed as an alternative to                       the traditional butter fat ghee. Vanaspati is semi solid and                       has a coarse granular structure at ambient temperature with                       crystals 1-2 mm in size, but is usually required to have a                       melting point of 37&deg;C - 39&deg; C. To the housewives, vanaspati                       offers distinct advantages. Food cooked in vanaspati has no                       characteristic flavour of edible oils. It has longer shelf-life                       and therefore, can be kept for a longer period. Some sweets                       and confectionery items of daily use which require a hard                       fat can only be made with vanaspati and not with liquid oils                       or ghee. Originally vanaspati was made from hydrogenated vegetable                       oils but hydrogenation is a fairly costly process and produces                       undesirable trans fatty acids.</p>
            <p align="justify"> Palm oil                       has similar physical characteristics to vanaspati such as                       melting point of about 36&deg;C and semi-solid consistency at                       ambient temperature, and although it does not naturally develop                       the desired granular appearance, this can be improved by interesterification.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="justify">Formulations                       based on interesterified blends of palm oil and its products                       (especially palm stearin) with a variety of other vegetable                       oils have been tested by PORIM with good results. All the                       tested samples were similar to the conventional hydrogenated                       vanaspati with respect to melting characteristics and physical                       appearance, including granulation and phase separation but                       most important, they were free of trans fattty acids.</p>

                <p align="justify">Foods products                       are said to be trans free if they contain no significant levels                       of trans fatty acids. They are formulated without the use                       of hydrogenated oils or animal fats which always contain some                       trans fatty acid.</p>
            <p align="justify">Some nutritional                       studies have shown that dietary trans fatty acids have adverse                       effects on health e.g. they have been shown to reduce the                       level of the beneficial HDL-cholesterol, and raise the level                       of the atherogenic LDL-cholesterol, so altering the LDL/HDL-cholesterol                       ratio detrimentally. These changes increase the risk of heart                       disease.</p>
            <p align="justify">Trans fatty                       acids also increase the level of lipoprotein Lp@, which is                       an independent and powerful risk factor for heart disease.Several                       other studies have implicated trans fatty acids in increasing                       the risk of cancer, interfering with fat metabolism and reducing                       the body's ability to rid itself of carcinogens, drugs and                       other toxins.Thus it is not surprising that many products                       use palm oil as natural source of trans free fatty acids.</p>

Palm oil is thus a balanced oil as                       it contains roughly equal amounts of saturated and unsaturated                       fatty acids. </p>
            <p>Coconut oil however contains                       about 87% saturated fatty acids in the form of 44.6% lauric                       acid (C12: 0), 16.8% myristic acid (C14: 0), 8.2% palmitic                       acid (C16: 0), 7.5% caprylic acid (C8: 0), 6.0% capric acid                       (C10: 0). The unsaturated fatty acids in coconut oil are 5.8%                       oleic acid (C18: 1) and 1.8% linoleic acid (C18: 2). </p>
            <p>Though palmitic acid, the                       predominant fatty acid in palm oil is a saturated fatty acid,                       it has been found to be less hypercholesterolemic than shorter                       chain saturated fatty acids. </p>

Carotenoids are usually thermally                           destroyed during the deodorization stage of the refining                           process. Their presence however, offers some oxidative                           protection to the oil by themselves being oxidised first                           prior to the triglycerides. </p>

The major forms                           of tocopherols and tocotrienols present in palm oil are                           alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocotrienols. Tocopherols and                           tocotrienols are antioxidants and provide some natural                           oxidative protection to the oil. </p>

                <p>The sterols in crude palm                           oil are in the form of sitosterol (218-370ppm), campesterol                           (90-151 ppm), stigmasterol (44-66 ppm), cholesterol (7-13                           ppm) and others (2-18 ppm). Upon refining, their levels                           are reduced to 68-114 ppm, 26-30 ppm, 12-23 ppm and 2                           ppm respectively. It must be emphasised that the cholesterol                           levels in both crude and refined palm oil are lower than                           levels in most vegetable oils. </p>

                <p>The main stages of processing                       FFBs are: - </p>
            <p><strong>(i) Sterilization</strong></p>
            <p> Fruit bunches are sterilized                       by steam at about 140&deg;C for a period of 75-90 minutes. The                       main objectives are to deactivate hydrolytic enzymes responsible                       for the breakdown of oil to free fatty acids; to loosen the                       fruits from bunches; to coagulate mucilage to facilitate breaking                       of oil cells and aid recovery of oil; and precondition nuts                       to minimize kernel breakage. </p>
            <p><strong>(ii) Bunch Stripping </strong></p>
            <p>The fruits are stripped and                       separated from the bunch in a rotary drum stripper. Fruits                       are knocked out of the bunch by the lifting and dropping of                       bunches as they pass through the stripper. The detached fruits                       fall through the spaces between the bars on the stripper and                       are collected in a conveyor, which then feeds them into the                       digester. </p>
            <p><strong>(iii) Digestion </strong></p>
            <p>Digestion involves the mashing                       up of the fruits under steam heated conditions. The digester                       is a vertical cylindrical vessel fitted with a rotating staff                       carrying a number of stirring arms. The action of the stirring                       arms breaks up the oil-bearing cells of the mesocarp to form                       a digested mash. </p>
            <p><strong>(iv) Oil Extraction </strong></p>
            <p>Twin screw presses are generally                       used to press out the oil from the digested mash. Hot water                       may be added to enhance the oil flow and the crude oil slurry                       is collected in the crude oil tank for purification. The fibre                       and nut (press cake) are conveyed to depericarper for separation. </p>
            <p><strong>(v) Clarification and Purification </strong></p>
            <p>The crude palm oil (CPO) mixture                       from the screw press consists of a mixture of crude oil (35-45%),                       water (45-55%) and fibrous materials and other solids in varying                       proportions. The mixture is pumped into a continuous clarification                       tank. The oil is maintained at about 90&deg;C to enhance oil separation.                       The oil is continuously skimmed off the top of the tank while                       the denser impurities settle at the tank bottom. The oil is                       passed through a high-speed centrifuge and a vacuum dryer                       to a moisture content of below 0.1% before being sent to the                       storage tank. </p>

                <p>The Deterioration of Bleachability                       Index (DOBI) is a ratio of the uncorrected absorbance values                       at 446 nm to that of at 269 nm. It is an indication of the                       bleachability of the crude palm oil based on the amount of                       carotenes still present in the crude oil and the amount of                       secondary oxidation products. A good easily bleached crude                       palm oil will have a DOBI of 4, while average quality crude                       will exhibit a DOBI of 2.5 to 3. </p>

                <p>Fats and oils contain complex                       organo-phosphorus compounds referred to as phosphatides or                       more usually, as gums. They are removed during processing                       by a variety of treatments collectively referred to as degumming.                       The treatment usually involves hydration with water, orthophosphoric                       acid, and polybasic organic acids either singly or in combination,                       followed by centrifuging the precipitated material or by its                       adsorption on bleaching earth or filter. </p>

                <p>Palm kernels produced during                       the milling process of palm fruits contain approximately 50%                       oil that can be extracted commercially via two methods, i.e.                       mechanical expression and solvent extraction. Palm kernel                       cake is the by-product of the oil extraction process. The                       main use of this product is as an ingredient for compounding                       animal feed. It has high fibre content and thus is usually                       used in foods for ruminants such as cattle. However palm kernel                       cake is also a good source of phytin, which is a precursor                       of phytic acid and inositol. The latter compounds have many                       industrial applications. PORIM has patented the extraction                       process for phytin and is working closely with the local industry                       to develop further into this new area. </p>

                <p>The aim of refining process                       is to reduce the free fatty acid content and to remove other                       gross impurities such as phosphatides, proteinaceous and mucilagenous                       substances present in crude oils. The process is normally                       carried out on vegetable oils as animal fats, are usually                       not refined. The most common method of refining is by treatment                       of the fat or oil with an alkali solution, i.e. chemical refining.                       This results in a large reduction of free fatty acids through                       their conversion into water-soluble soaps. Phosphatides, proteinaceous                       and mucilagenous substances are soluble in the oil only in                       an anhydrous form and upon hydration with the caustic or other                       refining solution are readily separated. Oils low in phosphatide                       content such as palm and coconut oils, on the other may undergo                       physical refining, i.e. by the use of stripping steam to distil                       off the more volatile impurities. </p>

                <p>During alkali refining, free                       fatty acids are neutralised by the alkali (sodium hydroxide)                       forming soap stock. This soap stock containing some emulsified                       neutral oil is separated and acidified with concentrated sulphuric                       acid to produce oil, which is mainly fatty acid. Acid oil                       requires further refining or purification before it is used                       in laundry soap and washing powder. </p>

                <p>Citric acid and other anti-oxidants                       are best-added on-line at the cooling stage after deodorization                       i.e. at temperatures of 120&ordm;C or lower. It is important to                       ensure complete dispersion and dissolution of antioxidants                       in the oil by the incorporation of a static mixer in the line.                       Citric acid is of course acidic, and therefore if it is not                       properly mixed, the build-up of localized concentrations could                       be detrimental to the tank coatings or to mild steel tank                       walls. </p>

                <p>&quot;Pressing&quot; is sometimes used                       during the fractionation process to separate small amounts                       of liquid oil from a larger quantity of solid fat. The process                       squeezes or presses the liquid oil from the solid fat by means                       of hydraulic pressure. This process is used commercially to                       produce hard butters from fats such as palm kernel oil and                       coconut oil. </p>

                <p>Winterization is a process                       whereby a small quantity of higher melting triglycerides is                       crystallized and removed from edible oils by filtration to                       avoid clouding of the liquid fractions at refrigeration temperatures.                       Originally, this processing was applied to cottonseed oil                       by subjecting the oil to ambient winter temperatures, hence                       the term &quot;winterization&quot;. Today, cottonseed oil is chilled                       using refrigeration and the practice has been extended to                       other vegetable oils.</p>
